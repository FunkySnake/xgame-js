                <h2>The rules</h2>
                <p>You are the Snake - a spaceship exploring the deep space. You are located near (but not too near) a giant black hole.</p>
                <p>Your mission is to collect tiny asteroids rich on proteinium - the rarest material in the galaxy and beyond.</p>
                <p>Beware of the fast rotating neutron star, that is captured by the black hole, in a vicious cycle. It's gravity is strong enough to splash you in pieces!</p>
